### Hello! 

My name is Troy and I am currently a Ph.D. student studying atmospheric sciences at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I spend most of my time looking at airborne remote sensing data! My current research interests include radar meteorology, lidar phase identification, weather modification, orographic precipitation, boundary layer clouds, Southern Ocean clouds, atmospheric rivers, extratropical cyclones, mesoscale snow bands, and quasi-linear convective systems. 

I am currently interested in learning more about parallel computing, machine learning, and anything Python. 

Check out some of my work looking at Southern Ocean clouds and snowstorms. 

When I'm not worried about the weather I like watching sports, hiking, skiing, reading, playing video games, and fishing!

Feel free to email me at: tzaremb2@illinois.edu if you have any questions.
